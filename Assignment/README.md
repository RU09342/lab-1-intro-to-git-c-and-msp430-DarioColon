# Overview

The math() function takes two different integers and a character operator. It uses a switch statement with "operator" as the case, and returns each operation.
The operations supported are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. It defaults to printing the string "Not a valid operation" if a character other than +, -, *, /, or % is used.
